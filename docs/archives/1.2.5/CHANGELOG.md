# 1.2.5

 - Added custom user documentation for Entities and Layers
 - Entity width and height no longer work as minimal values for resizable entities
 - Updated mouse cursor for entity resizing handles
 - Removed some useless tooltips in Rules panel
 - Fixed a crash when adding a value to an array of Int in an Entity
 - Fixed escaping of user docs strings in JSON
 - Fixed a crash with specific level background images
 - Fixed isolated "collapser" in Entity panel
 - Removed the help block at the top of all panels to make more room for content.

# 1.2.4

 - Added a new **Table of content** to the JSON, which lists all instances of any given entity.
 For example, this is especially useful if you want to have a quick access to the location of all PlayerStart entities in your game without parsing all your levels manually.
 To enable it, just check the "Add to table of content" option of an Entity definition.
 - Fixed lags in world view when using the fields render mode "Outlined text".
 - Fixed `A` key when using `WASD` navigation.
 - Fixed opacity inputs (icon, border and fill) in Entity panel.
 - Fixed incorrect main value when editing an existing group using Rules Assistant
 - Fixed an error with Haxe API when a tileset is not defined in layer definition.
 - Fixed the auto-layer assitant resize as you pan.

# 1.2.3

 - Entity definition properties can now be collapsed to give more room to the custom fields.
 - Fixed "FixedArray limit reached" crash
 - Fixed the wrong error message when duplicating an entity (ie. "You cannot have more than 0 Entity")
 - Added a big warning when creating a new project right in the app dir (any user files in the app dir are lost during updates)
 - Better warning when saving an existing project in the app dir.
 - Changed the way automatic colors are picked for new enum values, entities, intGrid values etc.

# 1.2.2

 - Added an option to use the old-school "opaque tables" visuals for Entity fields (see in the application settings, `F12` shortcut)
 - You can now pick an "outer" IntGrid value in the rules assistant. This allows to use the assistant to create transitions tiles between 2 specific IntGrid values (eg. grass/dirt)
 - Re-designed the [JSON online documentation](https://ldtk.io/json) to be *way* easier to use.
 - Updated the application settings window
 - Fixed `A` keyboard shortcut for non-WASD keyboards
 - Fixed external links in Release Notes window
 - The color of IntGrid values in the Rules Assistant are now shown in the pattern palette, in the lower-left corner of the window.
 - macOS builds are now "universal" like the Windows ones. This means that the official macOS release should now install properly on both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures. The downside is that the installer is now larger than before.

# 1.2.1

 - Fixed entity arrows not pointing at their target properly, if the source entity was resizable.
 - Better display of hotfixes vs major updates in the Release Notes window
 - Fixed position of the window listing all LDtk versions
 - Fixed macOS build

# 1.2.0 - Auto-layer rules assistant

## Auto-layer rules assistant

The new Assistant makes the creation of standard auto-tiles rules super easy!

Fill the layouts on the left using your own tiles and LDtk will create all the rules accordingly. By default, if you don't have all the orientations drawn, the assistant will automatically just use symmetrical rules to fill the gaps.

And if you forget something or want to make a change, you can simply edit the layout again to update the rules automatically.

![](1.2.0/rulesWizard.gif)

## WASD controls

You can now navigate through your current tool values using WASD keys.
 - In IntGrid layers, this will cycle through values,
 - In Entity layers, `W/S` will cycle through values, while `A/D` will quickly jump between tags
 - In Tiles layers, this will navigate in the current tileset. The selection will automatically use any previously "saved selection" to smartly navigate through your predefined group of tiles.

Because of this change, the following keyboard shortcuts were modified:
 - Switch to World mode: `SHIFT+W` or `~` (previously `W`)
 - Toggle single layer mode: `SHIFT+A` (previously `A`)
 - Save current tile selection: `SHIFT+S` (previously `S`)
 - Flip horizontaly currently selected tiles: `X` (previously `X` or `Z`)

![](1.2.0/wasd.gif)

## Entity fields visuals

The visuals of entity fields have been reworked again to increase clarity and reduce cluttering.
However, keep in mind it's always better to not display *everything*. The less, the better ;)

![](1.2.0/fields.png)

## Arrows
You can now customize the design of arrows used in Point or Entity Reference fields.

![](1.2.0/arrows.png)

## Auto-layer rules remapping

**TLDR; This new tool makes the creation of variations of Auto-layer rules very fast.**

For example, if you've created a bunch of rules that use the IntGrid value 1 to paint "Stone walls" tiles, you may duplicate and remap them to use IntGrid value 2 and, say, "Metal walls" tiles.

Right click on **a group of rules** in an Auto-layer to **Duplicate and remap it**.
This new tool allows you to make a copy of these rules, while doing the following operations:
 - replace IntGrid values they refer with another ones,
 - transpose the tiles they produce to another part of the tileset.

![](1.2.0/remap.png)

## Icons
New useful icons were added to the embed icons atlas, like keys, locks, and various shapes to be used with the 9-slices scaling feature of entities.

![](1.2.0/icons.png)

## Enum tags display

A new option allows to visualize "Enum tags" attached to tiles in the Editor context (thanks to [Keith Clark](https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk/pull/707)). Just press the new "Show/Hide enums" button near the Layers list.

In the following example, all tiles were tagged with a Material enum (stone, grass, metal etc.) and the result can be displayed right in the editor context.

![](1.2.0/enumTags.png)

## Custom commands

You can now define custom commands to be executed at various moments (when the project is loaded, saved etc.). These commands can be used for whatever your own production pipeline requires. Here are some typical examples:

- After saving, run a script that parses the JSON and extract all the texts for future localization.
- When pressing CTRL-R, run your game.
- After saving, parse the project JSON and check if all levels are properly connected, from your game logic perspective.

For obvious security reasons, LDtk will always ask you first if you trust the project and want to allow commands from it.

![](1.2.0/customCommands.png)

## Misc

 - You can add user-defined documentation to any entity or level field.
 - You can right click on a group of rules to modify the "out-of-bounds policy" of all its rules in a single batch.
 - Added nicer default colors for various elements (eg. int grid values, entities, enum values etc.). The palette is "*Endesga32*" by Endesga (https://lospec.com/palette-list/endesga-32)
 - Added a Color blind option in app settings: for now, this will only affect the colors automatically picked for new Entities, IntGrid values, Enums etc.)
 - Hold SHIFT to disable snapping when moving levels around in the world view.
 - You can now manually enter custom values for Entity pivots.
 - Many Load button in the UI will now remember properly their last folder
 - Added extra info to the Simplified Export JSON file (level custom fields, identifiers etc).
 - Added a new layer option to prevent selections when the layer is not active.
 - Fixed entity duplication that broke entity count limits.
 - Many UI fixes (thanks to [IrishBruse](https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk/pull/770)) to remove unnecessary borders and align things.
 - Added a "reset" button near any entity/level field that isn't using its default value.
 - Fixed duplicate identifiers when inserting a level in Horizontal/Vertical layouts
 - Fixed a crash when duplicating a point from an Entity.
 - Duplicating a selection containing Entities no longer ignores the limit counts defined for these entities.
 - Added support for proper Point duplication for entities that have an Array of Points field.
 - Fixed default multilines values that dropped newline characters.
 - Fixed the default tile of an entity when one of its fields is a Tile, but it is not set to override the entity tile itself.
 - Fixed the Rule editor window when the layer has no IntGrid value.
 - Fixed embed icons reloading when the image was resized.
 - Fixed useless scrollbar in context menus.
 - Fixed Haxe enum importer regex.
 - Fixed levels BgColor in JSON not updating when changing project default
 - Updated the design of the home.

## JSON changes

The following fields deprecated in update 1.0.0 were removed from the JSON in 1.2.0:

 - Removed `LayerDef.autoTilesetDefUid` (use `tilesetDefUid` instead).
 - Removed `EntityDef.tileId` (use `tileRect` instead).
 - Removed `NeighbourLevel.levelUid` (use `levelIid` instead).

## Haxe API

 - Added definition JSON access to Layers and Entities
 - Removed irrelevant entity arrays in layers that have "required tags" or "forbidden tags".
 - Fixed an exception with null defs.
 - Added `pxWid`/`pxHei` to layers

# 1.1.3

 - Fixed a crash on Home screen for macOS
 - Fixed path to samples on macOS

# 1.1.2

## Import enums from JSON and text files

You may now import project Enums directly from an external file (previously, only Haxe and CastleDB). This enum will be updated as you edit the file and LDtk will take care of value losses or renamings.

The following formats are now accepted :

 - **JSON**: expected format is
   ```json
   {
     "MyEnum1" : "a,b,c",
     "MyEnum2" : "a b c",
     "MyEnum3" : [ "a", "b", "c" ]
   }
   ```
 - **Text file**: one enum per line. Each line should use one of these formats:
   - `MyEnum : valueA, valueB, valueB`
   - `MyEnum : valueA valueB valueB`
   - `MyEnum : valueA ; valueB ; valueB`

## Better imported enums

The sync window for External Enums was completely reworked:
 - better UI,
 - added support for enums and values renaming.

You can now also import and sync Enums from a **Castle DB** file (http://castledb.org).

![](1.1.2/sync.png)

## Samples list

For new LDtk users, the samples are now much more visible in the default UI. Feel free to hide them by clicking on the [x] button.

![](1.1.2/samples.png)

## Other changes

- Fixed a crash when pressing `Delete` key while having no active selection.
- Fixed a crash when duplicating a level containing Entity references.
- Fixed incorrect entity ref description in Entity instance panel.

# 1.1.1

- *Super Simple Export* now also creates one **CSV file per IntGrid layer**.
- You can right click on a folder on the Home screen to create a new project there.
- Fixed IID's values and Entity references when duplicating a level.
- Fixed unexpected fill color for "hollow" Entities that use a Tile as a texture.

# 1.1.0 - Introducing the Super Simple export

## Super Simple export

**I know: for every new tool out there, there is this moment when you need to write the importer for your favorite game engine.**

I’ve been there too, so LDtk offers a *Super simple export* option. You can enable it from the **Project settings panel**.

You will get:

 - **One PNG per layer** in each level
 - A **composite” PNG per level** (ie. all layers merged together)
 - A very simple, straightforward and optional **JSON** file per level, if you want to access your Entities data or other information.

 More information on [how it works here](https://ldtk.io/go/simple).

![](1.0.1/simplifiedFormat.png)

## Other changes

 - Updated the look of notifications in the bottom right corner. Errors and Warnings will now also blink once to catch more user's attention, as needed.
 - Added a shortcut link to previous major version notes in "Release Notes" window
 - If you have "Open last project" enabled, but close current project, then re-opening LDtk will now bring you back to Home screen.
 - Removed recommendation to enable "External levels" in Project Settings panel.
 - Fixed missing coordinates display after going to World view.
 - Fixed `intGridValue` presence in JSON for non-IntGrid layers

# 1.0.0 - Gone gold!

## A few words from the author

**When I started working on LDtk about 1 year ago (which was known as *LEd* back then), I would not have imagined how far and how big this would get.** LDtk was a critical part of my personal game dev plan, because I knew I needed a modern, fast and user-friendly level editor for my future projects.

Along the way, a passionate community of level designers, aspiring game devs and tech enthousiasts gathered around the project, providing an incredible support and lots of precious feedback.

**To all of you, thank you.**

This 1.0 step is obviously a *major* milestone. It is the *biggest* update so far and it pushes LDtk to the next level (pun intended):

 - New entity reference system
 - Great performance boost for large projects
 - Integrated icons and many quality-of-life changes
 - New world layers
 - User interface reworks

I hope you will like it, as much as I enjoyed making it :)

## Entity references

This new "field" type is available to all Entities and is used to store a reference to another Entity.

A typical example is a *Button* entity with a Reference field pointing to another Entity, like a *Door*.

You can create arrays of References, or define restrictions to which kind of Entity they can point at. This new powerful feature unlocks lots of new exciting possibilities in a very user-friendly interface.

![](1.0.0/entityRefs.png)

## Integrated icons

LDtk now has an integrated icon tileset to make your Entities easier to read in the editor.

Please note that these icons were provided courtesy of their author, **FinalBossBlues**, and are to be used *only* in the editor environment.

If you want to use them in your game directly, you will need to license it from its author FinalBossBlue ([itch.io](https://finalbossblues.itch.io/icons)). He's a nice person, feel free to send an e-mail to get in touch :)

![](1.0.0/icons.png)


## General performances

Thanks to major optimizations, general performances will see a big boost, while reducing CPU usage, especially on large projects.

Loading and Saving operations were also vastly improved:
  - **Saving time** for large projects is much faster (approx. 8-15 times!) by caching elements that weren't modified.
  - **Progress bars** provide better feedback when working on large projects.
  - **Backup** system are faster and more reliable.

![](1.0.0/saving.gif)


## Editing performances

The way auto-layer rules are calculated was reworked (and a few bugs were fixed), making their rendering significantly faster, especially in large levels.

![](1.0.0/rulesPerf.gif)


## Undo/redo

The undo/redo engine was complitely rewritten in a much more simple and optimized fashion. This results in a huge performance boost for large levels, while also fixing some existing issues when undoing a Selection move.

![](1.0.0/undoRedo.gif)


## Rectangle of tiles for Entities

Entities (and levels too, actually) can use a new Custom Field type which can store a rectangle of tiles from any Tileset. This can be used as an alternative skin, an array of animation frames, an "opened" visual state for a a chest etc.

![](1.0.0/tileRect.gif)

## Copy and paste (work in progress)

For now, this crazy futuristic feature is only available for interface panels (eg. Layer definitions, Auto-layer rules etc.) but will be soon expanded to data in levels, such as entities or large chunks of layer elements.

You can right click on an element with a context menu to copy/cut/paste/duplicate definitions! LDtk just entered modern era.

![](1.0.0/ruleCopy.gif)

## Simplified world layers

Levels can now be organized in "depth" to support stacked levels.

![](1.0.0/worldLayers.gif)

## Reworked toolbar and shortcuts

The main editor toolbar was reorganized to be a little bit more logical:

 - `Level` button is now near the `World` button. They also share the same color.
 - The `Project` button is now brown and near the four Definition buttons.
 - The keyboard shortcuts for the various panels are now:
   - `P`: project settings panel
   - `L`: layers panel
   - `E`: entities panel (replacing the previous "Select empty spaces" option)
   - `U`: enums panel
   - `T`: tilesets panel (replacing the previous "Toggle tile stacking" option)
 - `F1` to `F10` keys are now associated with layers selection (replacing the previous `0-9` keys shortcuts)

![](1.0.0/mainBar.png)


## User interface improvements

The **`Space`** key now fulfills various roles:
  - Hit `SPACE` once to recenter view on current level or on the whole world (depends on where you are).
  - Hold `SPACE` and drag with `Left mouse button` to scroll the view.
  - Hold `SPACE` and drag with `Right mouse button` to zoom in/out.

The editor UI **font** nows uses *Noto* which offers better readability. While I was at it, I also fixed various font size issues with 2K and 4K monitors.

Enums and Tilesets can now be organized using **user defined tags**:

![](1.0.0/tags.png)

Errors in entities, such as a "null" custom field while being defined as "required", are now much more visible in the level view.

![](1.0.0/error.gif)

Contextual **help tips** were also reworked and streamlined in every existing panels. You now have a single small "?" indicator that gives all useful info you need for pretty much every editor options.

![](1.0.0/help.gif)

## Code signing on Windows

LDtk executable is now properly signed on Windows, which should ultimately get rid of "This application could destroy your computer" warning.

![](1.0.0/codeSign.gif)

## Other major changes

  - **IntGrid values sorting**: that's right, you can now sort your IntGrid values. Please note that re-organizing values will not remap them: so moving value "1" down, for example, will not modify it ("1" value stays "1"), only values order changes.
  - **Image reloading bug fixes**:
    - Reloading of images (tilesets, backgrounds etc.) will no longer occur if the app is not focused. As soon as LDtk is focused, images are updated.
    - Fixed a critical crash when reloading an image which has a different width/height.
    - You are no longer limited to deleting the last IntGrid value.
  - **Project colors**: when you pick a color, a list of all colors used in this project will be displayed, to make consistent color usage easier.
  - **"Identifier" format policy**: you can now pick your prefered "Identifier case policy" (default is "1st letter uppercased").


## File format changes

### Worlds

  - Added `worlds` array and `World` JSON structure to the docs. This was added as a preview for the upcoming new feature "Multiple Worlds in a single project". Learn more about that here: https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk/issues/231

### JSON changes

  - All new projects will now discard by default the deprecated data of IntGrid layers (ie. the **pre-"CSV format" data**). More informations here: https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk/issues/358
  - **IntGridValues** array index should no longer be used to guess IntGrid values, since the array can be manually sorted by users. See https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk/issues/553
  - To avoid unnecessary file changes and renamings (bad for versioning systems), the following changes have been made:
    - Irrelevant worldX/worldY values are now "-1" for all levels if the world layout is Horizontal or Vertical
    - Irrelevant __neighbours array is now empty for all levels if the world layout is Horizontal or Vertical
  - `tileId` in Entity Definitions has been replaced by `tileRect` to support multiple tiles instead of just single ones. The `tileId` will still be exported for now, but will be removed completely soon.
  - `levelUid` in Neighbours arrays has been replaced by `levelIid` (new string based IID). The `levelUid` will still be exported for now, but will be removed completely soon.
  - Merged the `autoTilesetDefUid` into `tilesetDefUid` for all Layer Definitions. This should have no impact if you properly used the `__tilesetDefUid` found in Layer Instances, as recommended in the docs. The `autoTilesetDefUid` will be dropped completely in a later update.
  - Added `__smartColor` to Entity instance JSON.
  - Fixed format of value "type" in JSON (now, it's always a String)
  - Fixed unexpected `intGridValues` in JSON for non-IntGrid layers
  - Fixed nullable Floats fields to now be really null in JSON.


## Multi-worlds experimental preview

You can try multi-worlds using debug menu. Please note that this feature is highly experimental and will probably evolve a lot in upcoming updates. Don't use for production.
   - Open an existing project,
   - Open debug menu (`CTRL+SHIFT+D`),
   - Create a new world,
   - Navigate through worlds using the context menu in empty spaces between levels.
   - Right click on an existing level in World view to move it between worlds.

### Other changes

  - External level files will no longer be prefixed with their index in array to avoid unnecessary renamings when inserting new levels. This can be re-enabled in Project panel, using an Advanced Option at the bottom.
  - Fixed `enumTags` and `customTileData` typing in QuickTypes files.
  - LDtk logs are now stored in a more legitimate location, depending on your OS. To locate your log file, just open settings (`F12` key) and look for the Log File line.

## UI

  - Entities can now use rectangle of tiles for their representation instead of just single tiles.
  - Added support for **9-slice scaling** mode for Entity tiles (how it works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-slice_scaling).
  - New dialog to configure auto-layer Rules modulo, with support for X/Y offsets.
  - You can now use `up`/`down` arrow keys to quickly increment/decrement an input value
  - You can now freely adjust fill/outline/tile opacities of Entities.
  - Current Level properties can now be edited directly from world view.
  - Entity and Level custom fields that are not using default value are now much more visible in forms.
  - Added a new optional "guide" grid per layer. This customizable grid is not used for snapping, and only serves as a visual guide.
  - Better display of entities that have error(s) in their field values.
  - Grid lines in levels are now truly 1 screen pixel thick.
  - Added a new option (`CTRL-H`) to hide everything except Tiles in layers (entities, labels, intGrids etc.)
  - Added an "App Settings" button to the main panel in editor
  - Added a "*" near level names if they were modified but not saved.
  - Added an error message when exporting to Tiled while having unsupported Aseprite images.
  - Added `PAGEUP`/`PAGEDOWN` keyboard shortcuts to zoom in/out
  - Added a unit selector (pixels/cells) near coordinates/size fields of entity instances
  - Tiles that overflow outisde of a level are now properly visually cropped.
  - Hold `SPACE` + Right mouse click to zoom in/out
  - Better support of trackpad pinch gestures to zoom in/out
  - Added a "Rename project" button in Project panel
  - Added Youtube video tutorials to the Help panel
  - Added "Release notes" button in Help panel
  - Added a "click trap" to prevent miss-clicks while the app is not focused. Previously, if you clicked on the LDtk window to re-focus it, you would edit some layer or click a UI element accidentally.
  - Changed `T` shortcut to `SHIFT-T` for "Tile stacking"
  - Changed `E` shortcut to `SHIFT-E` for "Select empty spaces"
  - Reworked the Enum panel and fixed many UX issues
  - Removed the "CPU throttling" option from the app settings. The CPU throttling has been reworked and should not longer be noticeable at all. Therefore, it is now always enabled to reduce battery usage on laptops and energy consumption in general.
  - Removed the "Tile Flickering Fix" option from the app settings: it was costly and inefficient.
  - Replaced the dashed lines used to connect points by a smoother zig-zag line
  - Entity fields and related visuals will now be faded away when not working in their layer.
  - Entity fields width will now be limited by their entity width (this greatly reduces screen clutter when having many fields displayed)
  - Custom fields of type Integer or Float can now have an optional text prefix/suffix to display in editor. Useful to display a unit near a value, like "0.5sec" or "$17".
  - Added more values for App UI scaling setting.
  - Added a Layer option to fade it away when it's not currently selected
  - Added a Layer option to hide it from the layers list
  - Moving mouse over UI components no longer interrupt view panning (Middle mouse click or Space+click)
  - The "collapsed/expanded" status of a group of auto-layer rules is no longer saved in the project file: all rule groups will now be collapsed by default when loading a project.
  - You can now manually reload any image asset (tileset, background etc.) using their "↻" button.
  - Tool tips are now larger and easier to read.
  - Mouse-overing entire rule blocks in the panel will no longer preview affected cells in the level. Now, to preview affected cells, you have to move your mouse over either the group name, or the "pattern" block.
  - You can now manually edit X,Y coords and width,height values of an existing Entity.
  - If you open a Backup copy of a project, all panels will be locked, preventing any edit. You may only Restore the backup.
  - Level identifiers are now displayed in the top-left corner of levels in World view
  - Better Level identifiers rendering in World view (they should now be easier to read in general)
  - Clicking on the "New Tileset" button immediately invokes the "Pick image file" dialog.
  - Creating a new Rule group will now immediately offer to rename it.
  - Changed the "Help" button color in the main editor bar.
  - Changed the aspect of various help-related elements.
  - Zooming out a lot now has a subtle dimming effect.
  - Added scrollbars to dialogs that are larger than app window (this could happen for example when using excessively big App UI scaling settings)
  - Reorganized the debug menu (`CTRL-SHIFT-D`)


## Bug fixes & misc

  - Many minor bug fixes.

# 0.9.3 - Ludum Dare 48 edition

  - **Aseprite support**: you can now load an Aseprite image directly as a tileset or as a level background. It will be automatically reloaded if it changes on the disk, just like any another image.
  - **Level PNG export**: it's now possible to export a single flattened PNG per level, making the "*Easy to integrate with your game engine*"-thing even easier. You can still export one PNG per layer per level if you prefer.
  - Fixed offseted "Close project" button
  - Fixed "textLanguageMode" typo in JSON
  - Minor bug & doc fixes

# 0.9.2

  - Added a tiny "(...)" above entities with fields when they are hidden
  - Fixed "re-open last project" that could sometime reset app settings
  - Fixed rule editor not updating when changing pivot
  - Fixed incorrect "Perlin noise" preview when right click on the Perlin option in Rules panel.
  - Fixed "shrinking" tileset view when panning it
  - Fixed discarded "levelPaths" array when importing OGMO projects

# 0.9.1

  - **Fixed broken "New project" button. Sorry!**
  - Added an option to **re-open last project** when starting LDtk (open Settings with `F12`)
  - Hold `CTRL` to disable preview when moving mouse over auto-layer rules.
  - Fixed missing tooltips in rules panel.
  - Fixed tooltips staying on screen in rules panel.


# 0.9.0 - Biomes and tags

## New features

  - **Optional auto-layer rules**: this new key feature allows to create "biome" and "variations" by defining group of rules that only apply to specific levels. Please check the new sample "`AutoLayers_5_OptionalRules`". How it works: simply right click on a group of rules in the Rules panel to mark it as `Optional`. This group will then be disabled by default everywhere, and you'll be able to manually enable it in some specific levels only.
  - **Tile tags**: you can now associate an Enum to a Tileset, then "paint" values from this Enum freely on each tiles in the tileset. This could be useful to mark collisions, water tiles, surface sounds or whatever tag you could think of. To use this new feature, just open the Tileset panel, select an existing Enum for a tileset, and start tagging directly.
  - **Tile custom data**: you can add totally custom text values to each tile in any tileset. This could be plain text, JSON, XML, etc.
  - **Auto level naming**: you can let LDtk name your level identifiers automatically using a **custom pattern**, as defined from the Project settings panel. Some examples:
    - default pattern "`Level_%idx`" will name levels "Level_0", "Level_1" etc, based on their order of creation (or order in array, in Horizontal/Vertical world layouts)
    - with the pattern `MyLevel_%gx_%gy`, each level will be named using the world grid X/Y coordinates (only applies to GridVania world layouts).
  - **Auto-layers tileset switching**: in each level and for each layer, you can now switch the tileset on-the-fly.
  - Added "Isolated points" as new display option for points in Entities (thanks to *Stuart Adams*)
  - Each **enum value** can now be associated with a custom color for easier reading in the UI.
  - Re-worked the **Rules panel** to have less buttons and lost space. Some actions where moved to the context menu (eg. renaming a group of rules)
  - Array of Points in Entities can now be displayed as "**looping paths**".

## JSON format

 - **WARNING**: last call before the removal of the deprecated value `intGrid` in `Layer instances`! If not done yet, please switch to the `intGridCsv` value. The old value will be removed on 1.0.0 update.
 - Added **tileset tags**: new array `enumTags` in `Tileset definition JSON` (see https://ldtk.io/json/)

## Other

  - Added an option in LDtk settings to start the app in fullscreen mode
  - Fixed cursor position while zooming
  - Fixed "close" button in Rules panel
  - Fixed scrollbar in Help panel
  - Updated README

# 0.8.0 - Level custom fields, resizable entities and more!

**Note for developers:** *IntGrid layers* JSON format changed in this update. For now, retro-compatibility is maintained with old importers, but this will be dropped after update 0.9.0, breaking outdated importers. Please read all the details here: https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk/issues/358

  - **UI rework**: many interface elements were reworked and cleaned up (less lines, less gutters). This includes panels, main side-bar, custom fields editor, etc. Also, the world panel is now separated from the "current level" panel, so it's no longer mandatory to go to "world view" to edit your active level settings. I hope you'll enjoy the changes :)
  - **Level custom fields**: just like Entities, you can now add custom properties to your levels and edit values per-level. For example, add some FilePath field, name it "music", filter allowed files with "mp3 ogg" and you get a custom music picker in each of your levels.
  - **Custom fields** have been visually re-organized to be easier to read in-editor. Labels and background are now aligned, and various minor display bugs were fixed.
  - **Resizable entities**: Entities can now be marked as resizable horizontally and/or vertically. This new feature opens the possibility of creating "Region" entities (ie. a custom rectangle or ellipses), with fully customizable properties.
  - **Entity tags**: tags are labels that can be freely added to any Entity definition. They can be used to group entities in the editor (ie. actors, regions, interactives etc.) and to filter allowed entities per layers (eg. a "*Region*" layer that can only contain "*region*" tagged entities).
  - **CPU optimizations**: the app CPU usage should now be close to 0% while its window is minimized or not focused. Also, a new setting "Smart CPU throttling" (*enabled* by default, recommended) will also reduce CPU usage while doing "not too demanding" actions in the editor. All these should greatly reduce battery drain on laptops.
  - **Ogmo 3 import**: you can now import Ogmo 3 projects to LDtk. Most features are supported, but feel free to drop a message on GitHub issues if you have any specific needs :)
  - The **UI scaling** has been fixed for 4K and 8K displays. You can now adjust the general application scale factor from the app settings (press `F12`).
  - **CodeMirror**: editing of "multi-lines" fields in entities (and levels) is now done using an almost fullscreen text editor based on *CodeMirror* library. This allows syntax highlighting, basic completion and various quality of life features. Supported types include XML, JSON, Markdown, LUA, JS, C# etc. Feel free to ask for more languages on GitHub issues.
  - **Debug menu**: you can now open a debug menu by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+D`. It will contain some commands that could be useful if you encountered some specific bug types. Commands inside this debug menu are *harmless*, so you can use them *without any risk* (unless some in-app message says the opposite).
  - Tileset can now be changed on-the-fly in each Tile layer.
  - The Windows **setup file** is now twice bigger. Yeah, I know this isn't an actual feature, nor a great change. *But* this opens support for both 32 and 64bits environments. Please note that the *installed* version size hasn't increased, only the *Setup* executable.
  - Moved buttons to the top of project Panels.
  - Removed all "Delete" buttons in project panels
  - It's now possible to associate icons with external enum values from a Haxe HX file.
  - Added a *Preset* button to quickly create a "Region" entity.
  - Entities can now be marked as "Hollow", which will allow editor mouse clicks to pass through, except on edges.
  - You can now show/hide multiple layers at once by holding left mouse button over visibility icons (Photoshop style).
  - Use `Shift` + left click on a visibility icon to Show or hide all other layers except the current one.
  - Added a button to access previous changelogs in "Update" window, on Home screen.
  - An Entity count can now limited per world or per layer. This is especially useful for elements like Player start position, which should be unique in the world.
  - A suggestion to enable Backups will now appear when opening a large project file.
  - The visibility status of a layer is now saved with the project.
  - When baking an Auto-layer (ie. flattening it), you are now given choices on what to do with the original baked auto-layer (delete, empty or keep).
  - Level background is now faded away in "Single layer mode".
  - Smarter auto-naming when duplicating something (ie. a copy of an Entity named "foo50" will now be "foo51", "foo52" etc.)
  - Each Entity field type now has an associated color, making field list easier to read.
  - The default size of a new level can now be customized from the World settings (press `W`, then open settings).
  - **Mouse wheel** can now be used to switch to world mode (and vice versa) automatically. A new related option has been to app settings (`F12`).
  - Fixed zoom speed using mouse wheel.
  - Fixed Point fields in entities where clicking the same coordinate twice added multiple identical points.
  - Fixed Rule "pink" preview being stuck when moving mouse over a level
  - Fixed incorrect default tile when creating a new Enum value.
  - Fixed "New project" dialog opening twice on Home screen
  - Disabled "New level" context menu when holding `Shift` or `Alt`
  - Fixed layer order for "simplified" level render in World view
  - Entity fields are now slightly faded out when not currently on an Entity layer
  - Fixed a "pink square" on Entities when reloading a texture modified outside of LDtk
  - Fixed entity instance editor not closing when switching level
  - Fixed a bug when adding *new Entity fields*, where some existing entity *instances* were not properly updated in the JSON file.
  - Fixed sorting of arrays in entity fields
  - The default behaviour when limiting an entity count is now to "Move the last one" instead "Discard the oldest one".

# 0.7.2

  - Added a setting to change font size in Editor UI.
  - You can now press `F12` to open app settings from almost anywhere.

  - Added a new "settings" button to LDtk home screen.
  - Fixed useless autoRuleGroups array in JSON
  - Added an option to force the app to always use the best GPU.

# 0.7.0 - Getting serious

This update features many important changes to make LDtk **production ready** and **future proof**. These changes will allow better support for large projects, better API creation and maintenance, and smoother user adoption.

**We are getting really close to 1.0!**

## Changes

  - **New home layout**: the app home screen has been re-organized to focus on what's really important.
  - **Separate level files**: when enabled, LDtk will save separately the project JSON and one file per level. A much needed feature to reduce JSON size and optimize parsing times! The option is in Project settings (press `F1`): "Separate level files".

    When enabled, all the project **settings** and **definitions** will still be stored in the `*.ldtk` file, and all level data will now be saved to separate files (one per level) in a sub-folder, in `*.ldtkl` files (notice the extra `l` letter at the end of the extension).

    **Important notes**: this new feature might not be supported in all current existing APIs and loaders. Also, this option isn't enabled by default, but this might change on 1.0.
  - **Save layers as PNG**: if you *really* don't want to bother with the LDtk JSON, you can check this new option in your project settings to export all your layers as PNG images (note: only supported layers will be exported, that is those with tiles).
  - **Backups**: automatically keep extra copies of your project in a sub-folder every time you save (enable backups in your project settings). **Important**: LDtk only keeps up to 10 backup files per project.
  - **Crash backups**: if, for some reasons, LDtk crashes, it will try to backup your unsaved work automatically. Obviously, this works even if the backup setting isn't enabled.
  - **Level background image**: each level can now have a custom background image (PNG, GIF or JPEG) that can be resized and aligned in various ways.
  - **New font**: replaced the often hard-to-read pixel font with a sleeker "Roboto" font (this change affects entity fields and floating level informations).
  - **New APIs**: LDtk JSON files can now be easily parsed in many languages, including **C#**, **Python**, **Rust**, **C++**, **Javascript**, using QuickType.io generator. These parsers are based on latest JSON schema file (see below) and are super easy to keep updated. You can check [existing APIs on the LDtk website](https://ldtk.io/api/).
  - **JSON Schema**: a schema file is now directly generated from source code (ie. a JSON that describes the LDtk project file format). It's available on [LDtk.io/json](https://ldtk.io/json) and contains a schema following Draft 7 standard from [Json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/). This file describes all fields from LDtk json files (value types and descriptions). The great thing about JSON schema is that it allows **JSON "parser" generation** using *QuickType*. That's right: you can now generate Rust, C#, JS or Python parsers easily, right from the file format.
  - **HaxeFlixel support**: the HaxeFlixel game framework has been added to the official [LDtk Haxe API](https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk-haxe-api). You can now easily load and display a LDtk project in your game.
  - Moving your mouse cursor over a **Rule group** in an auto-layer will now reveal all layer cells affected by the rules in this group.
  - If the auto-layer rule panel is open, moving your mouse over the level will now also highlight rules affecting the current coordinate.
  - The [JSON documentation](https://ldtk.io/json) now shows clearly what parts are useful for game devs and what parts aren't (trying to make your dev life even easier!).
  - The app home now shows a **list of recently opened folders** along with recently opened project files.
  - Optimized the rule pattern editor to update less UI stuff when being edited.
  - Tiled TMX files are now exported in a sub folder (along with other optional external files, like levels or layer PNGs)
  - Better organized world panel (shortcut `W`)
  - Better level name display in Linear world layouts.
  - Fixed reloading of tileset images.
  - Fixed Electron related security policy.
  - Fixed "Lost external enum file" dialog when loading a project.
  - Many UI tweaks
  - Bug fixes

# 0.6.2

  - Added an optional **Regular Expression** that can be tested against a `String` field in an Entity. Any unmatched character in a string value will just be discarded. This allows the creation of custom field type (that needs to follow some specific pattern), while still having a safety net (the editor cleans up invalid parts).
  - Fixed missing "world grid size" inputs in Grid Vania layouts. They should now appear in the World panel.
  - Fixed level creation in "Linear" world layouts that only contain 1 level
  - Fixed loading of null multiline fields
  - Fixed a crash on layer removal
  - Added "internal" (ie. "only for editor use") indicator for undocumented fields in Json
  - Fixed Json doc typo
  - Fixed Travis unit tests
  - Fixed new level creation in "Linear" layouts that only contained 1 level
  - Minor changes & fixes on Home and Support pages

# 0.6.1

  - **New website URL: [LDtk.io](https://ldtk.io)**
  - New Json schema URL: [LDtk.io/json](https://ldtk.io/json)
  - Updated in-app URLs
  - Fixed a crash when editing Entity points and switching layer
  - Fixed a crash in Tiled TMX exporter caused by tilesets without image
  - Fixed macOS build (didn't start properly).
  - Fixed long auto-update error message on Linux and macOS versions.
  - Fixed entities being destroyed when dragged near level limits
  - Fixed *samples* folder location on macOS
  - Updated buttons on app home page
  - Minor update to app logo

# 0.6.0 - Take over the world!

## 💬 Discord

We now have an official **Discord**! Come join us, we have cookies 🤗 Feel free to share the invite URL: **https://ldtk.io/go/discord**

## 🌍 World map

Levels in your project can now be organized in various ways:
  - freely on a vast 2D map,
  - in a large grid system (aka "grid-vania"),
  - horizontally,
  - vertically.

Just hit the `W` or `F2` key to switch to world view, and start re-arranging your creations as you wish! While in world mode, you can `right click` to reveal a context menu.

## 📑 Other changes

  - **New splash screen**: to reduce screen flickering and dirty window flashes on startup, a new splash screen was added, among other minor changes. The app window should now feel a little more "stable".
  - **Smooth zooming/panning**: automatic zooming and panning (eg. when pressing `F` key) are now animated and smoother.
  - **New rule editor window**: this UI component really needed some love, so it now features a more streamlined interface and a much better integrated help.
  - **User settings** are now stored in AppData OS folder to prevent from losing them on each future update. Unfortunately, this will only apply starting from this version, so settings will be reset one last time :) Sorry!
  - **End of beta**: LDtk is no longer considered *Beta* as it's now stable & mature enough to be used in production.
  - **"File path" field**: this new field type allow you to refer to an external file directly from an Entity instance (many thanks to [Yanrishatum](https://github.com/Yanrishatum)!)
  - Many *under-the-hood* optimizations to support the new World map feature.
  - Removed the "double" *Fit* mode when pressing `F`. Now pressing this key just fits the whole level in the viewport.
  - Unified R & Shift-R shortcuts: just press R to toggle all auto-layers rendering.
  - Fixed loading of files with spaces in name, when using file association on Windows
  - Better "invalid value" error display in entity fields (previously, you only had `<error>`).
  - Application samples will now display a warning if you try to save them (not recommended as they will be overwritten by future app updates).
  - Better Entity panel layout
  - Better default entity Field naming when creating a new one
  - Fixed a bug in Entity panel that went crazy when containing too many entities.
  - Sample maps are no longer added to "recent projects" list
  - Updated the Enum panel icon.
  - Better display of samples in recent files list on app Home.
  - Added a "Close" button to Project panel
  - Removed "Loaded" useless notification
  - You can now right-click external URL links in LDtk to copy them.
  - Fixed "new level" spot suggestion in Free and Gridvania worlds.
  - Fixed middle clicks on URL links.
  - Fixed many many issues with rules that didn't update properly after some specific changes (eg. perlin, checker mode, modulos etc.)
  - Added a "locate project" button to Project panel
  - Fixed an infinite loop when resizing a level
  - Fixed corrupted auto-layers when resizing a level using the width/height form fields.
  - Fixed a bug with files stored in a path containing some special characters (eg. ~ or %)
  - Updated the LDtk website
  - Updated all sample maps

# 0.5.2-beta

 - Fixed a crash when loading a project with a "lost" tileset image (ie. path not found).
 - Fixed crash window that looped forever
 - Better crash report window

# 0.5.1-beta

 - Added "top-down" sample map
 - Fixed "File not found" message at startup
 - Fixed a potential crash at startup
 - Fixed auto-reloading of modified tileset images
 - Minor bug fixes
 - Updated external libs used by LDtk (Electron, NodeJS etc.)


# 0.5.0-beta - LDtk: it's about tile!

**Level Designer Toolkit** (*LDtk*) is now the new app name :) I hope you'll like it! The logo was updated, as well as source code, GitHub repo and various other things.

Because of the renaming, users of the Haxe API will have to run the following commands:

```
haxelib remove led-haxe-api
haxelib install ldtk-haxe-api
```

You might also need to **manually uninstall any previous installation of LEd**.

 - **Tiles flipping**: in Tile Layers, you can mirror tiles before painting them by pressing `X` or `Y` (or `Z`). This also works from group of tiles.
 - **Tiles stacking**: you can now optionaly *stack multiple tiles in a single cell of a Tile layer*, reducing the need for multiple layers. For example, you could paint a brick wall, then enable stack mode (`T`), and add details like cracks or vines over the same wall. Be careful though: erasing of stacked elements can be tricky, so you should use a mix of multiple layers and stacking to get the best results.
 - **New editing options bar**: *Grid locking*, *Single layer mode* and *Empty space selection* moved to a new more streamlined button bar.
 - **File association**: project files now use the extension `*.ldtk` instead of `*.json`. Therefore, on Windows, double-clicking such files will open the app accordingly. If you prefer the `.json` extension, you can force it in each project settings (but will lose benefit of the file association).
 - **Auto-layer rule preview**: when you move your mouse over a rule, you will now see which cells in the current layer are affected, making their testing *MUCH* easier.
 - **Tiled (TMX) export**: this optional export now generates proper standard tile layers. However, to support LDtk stacked tiles feature (see above), multiple Tiled layers might be generated per single LDtk layer. Also, IntGrid layers are now properly exported to Tiled (as standard tile layers, with an auto-generated tileset image).
 - **New color picker**: it supports copy/paste, manual hex value editing and a much better UI (thanks to [simple-color-picker](https://github.com/superguigui/simple-color-picker)).
 - **Flood-fill fixes**: if you hold `SHIFT` while clicking in a Tile layer, it will flood-fill the area using currently selected tiles (randomly, or by stamping group of tiles, depending on the current mode).
 - **Flood-fill erasing**: just use `SHIFT`+`Right click` to erase a whole contiguous area.
 - The layer Rule editor now overlaps left panel and allows level editing while being open (makes rule testing much easier). Press `Escape` to close it.
 - In Tile layers, you can press `L` to load a saved tileset selection (using `S` key)
 - Renamed the *Level* panel to *World* (for the 0.6.x future update).
 - It's now possible to change the tileset or even the source layer of an Auto-Layer without loosing your rules.
 - **Auto-layer baking**: turn a complex Auto-Layer into a standard Tile layer (think of it as the *flatten* feature in Photoshop). Be careful, it's a one-way operation.
 - Unified "Show/hide grid" and "Grid locking" options. You can now just press `G` to toggle grid (which also implies "grid locking" in supported layer types).
 - All options (such as "Grid on/off", or "Compact panel mode") are now saved to a JSON file in your app folder, in `userSettings/`.
 - Help window is now a side panel.
 - Opaque tiles are detected in tilesets for use in various optimizations (mostly related to the new tile stacking feature).
 - Fixed a crash when deleting IntGrid layer while an AutoLayer uses it as source.
 - Added some colors to UI buttons
 - New exit button icon.

# 0.4.1-beta

 - Fixed a jQuery related crash
 - Smarter extern Enum file update (ie. silent if changes don't break anything).
 - Better logging in case of crash
 - Open/save dialogs are now modal to the application
 - Fixed distorted left panel in new projects

# 0.4.0-beta - Selections

 - Experimental **Ubuntu** and **MacOS** versions (thanks to the community!)
 - **Selections**: you can now select any element in a level by using `ALT` + left click. You can move it around by holding left click. To select a **rectangle area**, use `ALT` + `SHIFT` + left click.
 - **Duplicate**: you can duplicate any element in the level by drag it with `CTRL`+`ALT` keys.

    **NOTE: For now, "undoing" a *selection move or duplication* will require multiple undos (one per affected layer).** Undo/Redo features need a *major* rework, but this will only happen in a future update (see [#151](https://github.com/deepnight/led/issues/151)). Sorry for the inconvenience until this update!

 - **Duplicate definitions**: you can duplicate any *Definition* (layers, enums, entities etc.) by using the new context menu (right click or use "3-dots" buttons) in all panels.
 - **Duplicate rules or rule groups**: another much needed addition.
 - **Multi-lines texts** added to Entity custom field types.
 - **Type conversions**: Entity fields can now be converted to different types (like turning an *Integer* value to a *Float*, or into an *Array*). Some conversions might not be lossless.

 - Renamed the old *Enhance active layer* option to **Single layer mode**
 - `Alt`+`left click` now picks elements in *all* layers. If you have the *Single layer mode* activated (`A` key), it will pick in current layer only.
 - Added an option to allow selection of empty spaces
 - Better mouse coordinates display in editor footer
 - Added *rectangle selection size* to editor footer
 - Use `DELETE` key to delete selected elements
 - Use `CTRL`+`A` shortcut to select everything (limited to current layer in *Single Layer Mode*).
 - Optimized the JSON format to reduce its size (should be approximately 40-50% smaller).
 - Added the up-to-date *JSON format doc* to the app Home page.
 - Added fullscreen button to view Home *changelogs*
 - Pressing `ENTER` on the Home screen now opens last edited map.
 - Side bar is now more compact
 - Better "Enum sync" window
 - Fixed "Enum value in use" detection
 - Removed duplicate sample map file
 - Fixed mouse wheel zoom limits
 - Fixed "color" field size in Entity instance editor when the value wasn't default.
 - Updated help window
 - Pressing `Escape` key now leaves focused inputs first instead of closing panels.
 - Many bug fixes & minor enhancements

# 0.3.2-beta

 - Fixed a crash when resizing level with an Entity having a null Point value
 - Added button icons in Help window

# 0.3.1-beta - Tiled import

 - **Tiled (TMX) export option**: from the project settings (`F1`), check the *Tiled export* option to save Tiled compatible files along with the LEd JSON.

    **DISCLAIMER**: this export is limited because Tiled doesn't support some core features from LEd, like different grid sizes in the same level or Array of properties in Entities. This export is only meant as a short-term solution to quickly load LEd data in a framework only supporting TMX files. See [documentation](https://ldtk.io/docs/general/exporting-tiled-tmx/) for more informations.

 - Better active/inactive visual state for rules and groups of rules in auto-layers
 - Inactive rules are no longer exported in the JSON file
 - Pressing `F` key twice fits the current level in view but with less padding
 - Added an automated JSON format documentation generator (see [JSON_DOC.md](https://github.com/deepnight/led/blob/master/JSON_DOC.md) in sources)
 - Added version badges in the JSON doc to quickly identify changes per versions.
 - Updated home page
 - Updated `sample` maps

# 0.3.0-beta

 - **Group of tiles in auto-layer rules**: this new feature allows you to place larger objects (eg. *a tree, a big rock, etc.*) made of multiple tiles using just auto-layer rules.
 - Added **Modulo** options for auto-layer rules: this allows a rule to only apply every X columns or Y rows.
 - Added **Checker mode** for auto-layer rules: this makes effects like "brick walls" or "Sonic checker effect" possible ;)
 - **Better hot-reloading**: when a tileset images changes on the disk, LEd will automatically remap tile coordinates if the image size changes. This feature now also works to remap auto-layer tiles.
 - **JSON changes**: please check the new [JSON_CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deepnight/led/blob/master/JSON_CHANGELOG.md) for up-to-date changes to JSON format.
 - Fixed image import that failed if the image file was standing on a different drive than the project file.
 - Fixed rule `random` function giving identical results for different rules
 - Fixed a crash while editing rules in *pure* auto-layers.
 - Fixed a crash when Undo history reaches its max (might need more rework).
 - Prepared support for Mac & Linux versions
 - Minor fixes for Linux builds
 - Updated `Samples`
 - Bug fixes


# 0.2.1-beta

 - Added `F1`-`F6` key shortcuts for all editor panels
 - Updated JSON file format with some extra dev-friendly values
 - Added a JSON changelog file for devs working on importers
 - Add JSON changelog to app start page

# 0.2.0-beta - Beta version

 - **Beta version!**: LEd is now stable enough to be used in production and retro-compatibility will be guaranteed from now on.
 - **Radius**: Integer and Float entity fields can now be displayed as a radius around the entity (eg. a "lightRadius" Float value can now be displayed accordingly right in the editor display). See `Samples` for some examples.
 - **Smart color use**: if you have a Color field in an entity, it will be used when displaying various values in the editor (eg. having a "lightColor" field will affect the color of the circle around the entity).
 - Added support for **tile spacing** and **padding** in Tilesets images.
 - Entity **Arrays** can now be sorted manually
 - Entity tiles can now be displayed as "stretched" (default) or "cropped".
 - A preview of the "Perlin noise" is displayed while editing the settings of an auto-layer rule perlin.
 - Added **mouse coords** in the bottom-right corner of the window.
 - Updated appearance of selected entities
 - Added a field display option to use Enum tiles in place of Entity tiles
 - Added a new option for entities with count limits ("move last one instead of adding").
 - "Enhance active layer" option is now false by default (press `A` to toggle)
 - Entities can now be displayed as "Crosses"
 - Various UI fixes in "Compact" mode (when pressing `TAB`)
 - Fixed relative paths remapping when "Saving As" project
 - Fixed level resize issues which moved Entities and their Point fields in a strange way
 - Fixed panels/windows not closing during app update
 - Fixed SaveAs shortcut (`CTRL+SHIFT+S`)
 - Better entity tile picking UI
 - Updated `Samples`
 - Bug fixes

# 0.1.7-alpha

 - **Array of entity fields**: any field type in an Entity can now be an Array. For example, you could have an Array of Enums to represent the items hidden inside a Cratebox entity. See `Samples` for some examples.
 - **Point coordinates & paths**: this new entity field type allows you to pick a grid coordinates. And if you combine this with the new Array support, you can even build paths of points! See `Samples` for some examples.
 - Added a confirmation when trying to update the app while having unsaved changes
 - UI tweaks & fixes
 - Added some click tolerance when picking entities
 - Swapped "Tileset" and "Enum" buttons in main toolbar
 - Fixed an infinite loop on undo/redo in some levels
 - Updated Haxe API
 - Bug fixes

# 0.1.6-alpha

 - **"Pure" auto-layers**: these layers only have rules and use a separate IntGrid layer as source for their value checks. Very useful to have a separate auto-layer that contains drop-shadows of walls, for example. You can have any number of pure auto-layers using the same single IntGrid source.
 - Grid lock (formerly grid snap) now uses `L` key shortcut instead of G
 - Grid visibility can be toggled using `G` key shortcut
 - Added `SHIFT-R` shortcut to show/hide all auto-layers
 - Updated sample projects
 - Updated "help" window
 - Added quick notifications for some user actions
 - Fixed render issues when deleting or updating auto-layer rules
 - Fixed Haxe API issues
 - Fixed bugs
 - Added some internal app logging for debugging purpose (no sensitive data, don't worry)

# 0.1.5-alpha - Auto layers

 - **Auto-layers**: IntGrid layers can now render themselves automatically by drawing tiles based on their content. You can create "patterns of IntGrid values" (called **Rules**) to decide when a specific tile, or group of random tiles, should appear. It can for example be used to:

   - etc.

 - *`Samples`*: click on the `Samples` button on home page to load some example projects.
 - **Smarter warning** when deleting something in a panel. ie. If the value you're removing isn't actually used in your project, you will get a "softer" warning.

 - Added a project option to minify the JSON file.
 - Smarter extern Enum sync: the removal of unused enums will be shown as low-risks operations.
 - Added perlin noise support to Auto-layers rules (a rule can apply to only a random area).

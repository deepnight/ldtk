	<p>A rule is used to display a specific tile based on the content of an IntGrid layer.</p>
	<p>
		For example, you could create a rule that will display "grass" tiles above every walls.
	</p>
	<p>
		To describe the "context" (ie. where and when your tile should be displayed), you paint a pattern: that's the grid below.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="tileSettings">
	<select name="tileMode" title="**RANDOM** One tile among selected ones will be rendered in matched layer cells\n **RECTANGLE** A rectangle of tiles will be be rendered in matched layer cells"></select>
	<div class="picker" title="**Choose tile(s)** You can hold mouse button to select multiple tiles."></div>
	<div class="options" title="For rectangle of tiles, you can adjust the PIVOT point of the rendered rectangle."></div>
</div>
<div class="help">
	First pick which tile(s) you would like to automatically render. Start with something very simple: a wall block, grass, etc.

<div class="pattern">
	<div class="values" title="This panel shows all the IntGrid values defined in this layer">
		<ul></ul>
	</div>

	<div class="editor">
		<select name="size" title="Choose the pattern size. WARNING: patterns larger than 5x5 might slow down the app!"></select>

<div class="help big">
	<p>
		The center of this PATTERN is where your TILE(s) will be rendered (). Paint the pattern to describe in which context the tile(s) should be displayed:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="icon mouseLeft"></span>: paint "This IntGrid value is required" in a cell</li>
		<li><span class="icon mouseRight"></span>: paint "This IntGrid value should NOT be here".</li>
		<li><span class="icon mouseMiddle"></span>: clear pattern cell".</li>
		<li>Use the <strong>Anything</strong> special value to match "Any IntGrid value" or "No IntGrid value at all"</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For example, if you want to paint "wall blocks" where you have the IntGrid value "1" in your level, you just put the IntGrid value "1" in the center of this pattern.
	</p>
	<p>
		This means: "if any cell in my level contain value 1, paint the given tile(s) there".

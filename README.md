# Getting LDtk latest version

Visit [LDtk.io](https://ldtk.io) to get latest version.

# Building from source

## Requirements

 - **[Haxe compiler](https://haxe.org)**: you need an up-to-date and working Haxe install  to build LDtk.
 - **[NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**: this package manager is used for various install and packaging scripts. It is packaged with NodeJS.

## Installing required stuff

 - Open a command line **in the `ldtk` root dir**,
 - Install required Haxe libs:
 ```
 haxe setup.hxml
 ```
 - Install Electron locally and other dependencies through NPM (**IMPORTANT**: you need to be in the `app` dir):
 ```
 cd app
 npm i
 ```
 - To get the scss compiling to css you need to install sass through the commandline
 ```
 npm i -g sass
 ```
 Once sass is installed you can then run the task `scss watch` in vscode to start it watching for changes


## Compiling *master* branch

First, from the root of the repo, build the electron **Main**:

```
haxe main.debug.hxml
```

This should create a `app/assets/main.js` file.

Then, build the electron **Renderer**:

```
haxe renderer.debug.hxml
```

This should create `app/assets/js/renderer.js`.

## Compiling another branch

If you want to try a future version of LDtk, you can checkout branches named `dev-x.y.z` where x.y.z is version number.

**IMPORTANT**:
 - these *dev* branches might be unstables, or even broken. Therefore, it's not recommended to use, unless you plan to add or fix something on LDtk.
 - because *dev* branches might change quickly, you will need to update haxelibs often.
 - you will need to switch the *LDtk haxe API* to the **same** branch as LDtk repo. (adapt the branch name below accordingly):

```
haxelib git ldtk-haxe-api https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk-haxe-api.git dev-0.6.0
```

## Running

From a command line in the `app` folder, run:

```
npm run start
```
